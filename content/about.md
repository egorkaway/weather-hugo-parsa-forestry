As long as one spends any time outside knowing what weather is coming your way is a basic need.

However, the way we talk about whether is mostly structured by the needs that were important 70 years ago.

Weather forecasts, apps, and news coverage are of course still relevant in many situations and places around the world, but we believe that starting from scratch and reinventing the approaches might be reasonable each decade or at least each century.

Thus, we are here to build a weather service relevant for the 2020ies and 21 century.
