This is the planet that will be most interesting and easiest to observe throughout July. It will become the brightest by July 14, when it is in a confrontation with the Sun and is clearly visible in the night sky.  
  
If you arrange yourself with binoculars, you will be able not only to have a good look at the disk, but also to see 4 moons of Jupiter.  
  
And if you manage to go out the city, and moreover with a telescope, you will see such interesting details as stripes on the disk and even the Big Red Spot.
