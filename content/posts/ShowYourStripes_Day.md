June 21st is [#ShowYourStripes](https://showyourstripes.info "Show Your Stripes ") day, a global initiative aimed at raising awareness about climate change. The day is named after the iconic "climate stripes" graphics, which depict the warming of the earth's surface over time using a simple color scheme, with blue representing cooler temperatures and red representing warmer temperatures.

The climate stripes were first developed by climate scientist Ed Hawkins in 2018, and have since been widely used to show the impact of climate change in a visually striking and easy-to-understand way. On #ShowYourStripes day, individuals and organizations around the world are encouraged to share their own climate stripes graphics on social media, using the hashtag #ShowYourStripes to spread the message about the urgent need for action on climate change.

The severity of the climate crisis cannot be overstated. The planet is warming at an alarming rate, leading to devastating consequences such as rising sea levels, more frequent and severe natural disasters, and mass extinctions of plant and animal species. The good news is that we still have time to take action and prevent the worst effects of climate change, but we must act quickly and decisively.

By participating in #ShowYourStripes day, we can help raise awareness about the urgency of the climate crisis and inspire others to take action. Together, we can build a more sustainable future for ourselves and for generations to come.\
