March 20 is the day of the vernal equinox, after which the length of the day will gradually become longer than that of the night.

On the equinox day the Sun will cross the celestial equator and equalize day and night. That will start an astronomical spring in the northern hemisphere. Accordingly, an astronomical autumn will come in the southern one.

Literally translated from Latin, the vernal equinox means “equal night.” Since ancient times, this day had a special meaning for people and symbolized the victory of light and life over darkness and cold. Well, we are waiting for warmth and sun.
