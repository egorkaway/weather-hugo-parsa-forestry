Great news for all those who have at home not even professional, but amateur telescopes: all week from August 3 to 9, in the evening and morning twilight, three comets will be seen in the sky simultaneously: Neowise, Panstarrs, and Lemmon. Comets move along the constellations of the Hair of Veronica and Bootes near the bright star Arcturus.

The closest approach of comets will occur on August 6.

So look for a telescope or observatory in your city and watch the unusual sky show.
