Can an island move? Yes, but only if itâ€™s an unusual floating island located in the Lake Pond in Massachusetts.  
  
This football-sized island is made up of moss and stays afloat because of the gases these very mosses produce.  
  
The floating island does not have an exact route; it moves along the lake rather randomly and sometimes even destroys buildings and moorings by approaching too close to the shore.  
  
It is forbidden to tie or immobilize the island in any other way, since scientists have determined it as unique.
