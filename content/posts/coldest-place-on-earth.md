Recently we’ve told you about the hottest place on the planet. Today we are ready to tell you where is the coldest one.

In 2018, scientists got a record cold temperature: -98.6 °C. This was done in the eastern part of the Queen Maud Land in Antarctica. Several cracks from 2 to 4 meters deep are located there accumulating icy air. If you breathe at this temperature it may easily provoke rather serious burns.

Until 2018, the cold temperature record was considered to be -89.2 °С, which was recorded at the Vostok research station in 1983 in Antarctica.
