On June 7 and 8 Jupiter, Saturn and the Moon will appear together in the night sky.  
  
This arrangement of three celestial bodies in the same line is called «dance of planets», and it can be well seen immediately after midnight. And for this, you will not even need a telescope.  
  
So it’s time to mark these dates on the calendar and hope for a cloudless night sky.
