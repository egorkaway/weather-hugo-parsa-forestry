Lenticular clouds are one of the most beautiful natural phenomena. When you first see them in a photo, it’s hard to believe that this is a real shoot, not a photoshop.

Lenticular clouds are quite rare and can be observed mainly in mountainous areas. Most often they are recorded in the United States, Kamchatka, and near Mount Fuji in Japan.

The main and the most interesting feature of these clouds is their immobility even if the winds are strong. Air flows pass by these massive clouds and create the airwaves in which the continuous condensation process takes place. That’s why these clouds do not change their position in space.
