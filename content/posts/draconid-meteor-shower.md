Another meteor shower this week.

Ideal time for observations: October 8 at 20:00 UT, as well as October 9 at 4:00 UT and from 9.30 to 12.40 UT.

The last Draconid meteor shower took place in 1999. According to scientists, this year the average number of meteors will be about 30 per hour. And the record was set in 1933, when the number of meteors exceeded 1000 per hour!
