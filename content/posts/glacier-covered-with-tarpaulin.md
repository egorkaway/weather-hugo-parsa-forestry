In Italy a glacier was covered with tarpaulin to protect it from melting.

In the northern Italy, environmentalists are right now trying to cover the Presena Glacier in the Alps with tarpaulin.

Long-term observations say that since 1993 the glacier has already lost more than a third of its area and the situation is getting worse.

To prevent the disappearance of the glacier, scientists have come up with an extraordinary solution: to cover it with a special tarpaulin that reflects sunlight and protects the glacier from heating.

The planned coverage area is about 100,000 mÂ².
