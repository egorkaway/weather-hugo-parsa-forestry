It is considered that the Moon can be observed only at night. However, in fact, it can easily be seen in the afternoon. And by the way, this very question “why the Moon is in the sky during the day” is often asked by children who are much more observant than adults.

What the day appearance of the Moon depend on? It depends on the phase of its growth. The growing Moon is clearly visible in the afternoon, and the waning Moon can be seen in the morning. Therefore, just check the lunar calendar and you can see the Earth’s satellite in the day time.
