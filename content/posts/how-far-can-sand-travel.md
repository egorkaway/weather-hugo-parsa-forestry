Did you know that there is a regular sand service between Africa and America?

It turns out that the sands from the Sahara desert annually “travel” across the Atlantic Ocean and settle in the USA and in the Amazon forests. Subequatorial winds carry the sand twice a year: in late spring and early autumn. Along the way, about 15% of dust is lost in the ocean, however, about 150 million tons of sand reaches only the Amazon region.
