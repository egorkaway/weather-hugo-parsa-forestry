The current Atlantic hurricane season promises to be the strongest for the last few years.

The annual hurricane season starts in the Atlantic Ocean on June 1 and it will last till the end of November. According to the forecast of the Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the 2020 season will surpass previous years as for the strength and frequency of storms and hurricanes.

If the average number of hurricanes is 12 storms per season, this year their likely forecasted number can reach 19, and it is expected that from 3 to 6 of them will be especially strong.

Well, 2020 is still testing us for strength. So be prepared, keep calm, and follow the forecasts.
