The night sky in January is traditionally considered the most beautiful and generous for astronomical observations’ lovers.

The bright constellations of Orion, Taurus and Auriga will be clearly visible above the southern horizon. In addition, it will also be possible to perfectly see the Horsehead and Orion nebulae, as well as the most beautiful star clusters of the Pleiades and Hyades.

Among other things, in January it will be possible to observe the brightest night star — Sirius. Look for it at the horizon in the southern part of the sky. And when you find Sirius, you will be able to find the famous "Winter Triangle" as well: Sirius (Alpha Canis Major), Betelgeuse (Alpha Orion) and Procyon (Alpha Canis Minor).

The Milky Way in January 2021 can be seen at the zenith from the southeast to northwest.
