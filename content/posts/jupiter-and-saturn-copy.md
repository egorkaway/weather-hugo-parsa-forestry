The nights in May are almost the shortest of the year, however, one can see a lot of interesting things in the sky even in such short night hours.  
  
For example, you can even observe two planets right in the East without any telescope: these are Jupiter and Saturn.  
  
Both appear low above the horizon a couple of hours before sunrise. Jupiter shines much brighter than other stars and therefore it is easier to notice. And look for Saturn 5Â° to the East of Jupiter. Both celestial bodies shine smoothly, calmly and without any flicker characteristic for other stars.
