Light drizzle is a type of precipitation with very small raindrops. The drops are around 0.2 to 0.5 millimeters in diameter, making them barely visible. Light drizzle often occurs in cooler temperatures between 10 to 18 degrees Celsius. The air is usually calm with little wind.

Light drizzle forms when low, gray clouds called stratus clouds cover the sky. The tiny water droplets in these clouds remain suspended and slowly fall to the ground. This creates a misty effect.

Compared to other types of rain, light drizzle is much more gentle. The tiny droplets result in a light touching of rain rather than a heavy downpour. An umbrella may not be needed as light drizzle will not soak clothes very much. It provides a mild, subtle rain experience.

When light drizzle occurs, take note of the extremely small raindrop size falling from the overcast sky in a calm manner. This different type of precipitation creates a hazy condition with very light rain.
