The first spring star rain on April 21-22.

Next week we will be able to see the first spring star rain. On April 21 to 22, we will have a chance to observe the largest meteor shower in the Northern Hemisphere â€” the Lyrid shower, whose maximum will fall on this night.

Astronomers say the number of meteors can reach 18-20 per hour. The radiant of this stream is located in the constellation Lyra. And it is best to observe it at night and before dawn, first over the northeastern horizon, and then in the eastern part of the night and morning sky.
