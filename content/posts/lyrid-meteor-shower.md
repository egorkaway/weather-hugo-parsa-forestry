Get ready for a meteor spectacle! The first spring star rain is on its way, and you won't want to miss it.

On April 21 to 22, we will have a chance to observe the largest meteor shower in the Northern Hemisphere — the Lyrid shower, whose maximum will fall on this night.

Astronomers say the number of meteors can reach 18-20 per hour. The radiant of this stream is located in the constellation Lyra. And it is best to observe it at night and before dawn, first over the northeastern horizon, and then in the eastern part of the night and morning sky.

Look to the skies in the early hours of the morning of April 22, and catch the radiant stream in the constellation Lyra. Don't blink or you might miss it!
