What interesting can be seen in the May sky? If you pay attention to its western part near the horizon, your attention will be definitely attracted by a bright shining star. This is the planet Venus. It is difficult to confuse it with other stars, as it is much brighter and does not flicker.

It is better to observe Venus until mid-May, as by the end of the month it will be disappearing earlier and earlier with each passing day.

By the way, the next appearance of Venus in May will happen only in 2023, so try not to miss its current appearance in the sky.
