Let's assume you are going to observe Mercury from May 15 to 22. What needs to be done to determine its location? To begin with, find Venus, the largest and brightest star, and a little lower, almost above the horizon, you can find Mercury, which also differs from other stars with its intense white light.

It is best to watch it in the very first hours after sunset.
