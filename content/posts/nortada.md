The Nortada wind usually happens during the spring and summer seasons in Portugal. From May to September, this amazing wind comes along the coast to bring relief from the heat and make everything feel cooler and more comfortable.

Nortada wind happens because of the difference in temperature between the land and the sea. When the inland areas get hotter, the air rises and creates a kind of empty space. Then, the cooler air from the ocean rushes in to fill that space, creating the refreshing Nortada wind that blows from the north and northwest along the Portuguese coast.

Cities That Feel It:
Several cities in Portugal get to feel the wonderful Nortada wind. Places like Porto, Viana do Castelo and Aveiro are some of the lucky ones. Since these cities are close to the ocean, they get to enjoy the refreshing breeze that the Nortada brings.

There's a popular beer brand in Portugal called Nortada. It takes its name from this refreshing wind. Nortada beer is known for its delicious and unique flavors that perfectly complement those warm summer days when the Nortada wind is blowing. 

Nortada also wind holds recreational significance, attracting windsurfers and kitesurfers who seek its favorable conditions for their sports.
