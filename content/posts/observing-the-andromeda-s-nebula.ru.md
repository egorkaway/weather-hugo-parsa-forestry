Already in mid-September, immediately after sunset, it will be possible to observe the galaxy beautifully named as "Andromeda's Nebula" (M31). It will be possible to see it more clearly through binoculars, and if you also have a telescope, then you will be able to see its satellites - compact elliptical galaxies M 32 and M 110.  
  
As a pointer, you can start with the Shedar star in the Cassiopeia constellation (look for the Andromedaâ€™s Nebula below and to the right) or with the Alferatz star in the left corner of the "Pegasus square" (Andromeda will be to the left).  
  
Enjoy your observations!
