There is a wind that travels all the way from North Africa to southern Europe, bringing warmth and moisture along its journey and it is called the Sirocco.

The Sirocco likes to visit Southern Italy and the Balkans during the spring and autumn seasons. It happens because of the interaction between high-pressure systems over the Atlantic and low-pressure systems over the Mediterranean. When the warm air from the Sahara Desert meets the cooler air over the Mediterranean Sea, they collide and create a powerful wind.

In Southern Italy, cities like Naples, Palermo, and Bari get to meet the Sirocco quite often. When it arrives, the temperature goes up, and it becomes hot and sticky. The air gets a bit hazy too because of tiny dust particles floating around.

The Balkans, including cities like Dubrovnik, Split, and Athens, also get to experience the Sirocco's visit, here this wind helps crops grow by bringing moisture during dry times.

So, the Sirocco is more than just a wind. It's an amazing traveler that brings warmth, moisture, and even challenges to the places it visits. It's like a special guest who leaves a mark on the weather and the nature around us.Â
