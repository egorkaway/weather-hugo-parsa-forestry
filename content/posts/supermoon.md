Already this week, May 7, weâ€™ll be able to observe the last Super Moon of the year. This interesting and very beautiful natural phenomenon occurs when the distance between the Moon and the Earth is reduced to the minimum.  
  
This is exactly what will happen on May 7 at 1:46 p.m., when the Moon will be clearly visible in the sky in daylight. The nocturnal appearance of the Earth satellite will take place at 20:30, and from that moment it will be possible to observe the unusually bright and large Moon.  
  
According to forecasts, the inhabitants of Florida, California, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Puerto Rico will enjoy the cloudless night sky and will have the opportunity to see The Super Moon. But Texas residents will have time only before midnight, as there is a risk of losing the Moon behind the clouds.  
  
By the way, according to ancient legends, on this night you can make any wish, and it will come true. And even if the Moon hides behind the clouds, its magic will not disappear.
