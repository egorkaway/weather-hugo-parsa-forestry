What are «White Nights»?

This is the name of the twilight, which lasts all night. From an astronomical point of view, twilight is understood as a period of time when the Sun is shallow below the horizon.

During the white nights, natural light remains high. The lightest night falls on June 21-22, its duration is 5 hours 12 minutes, and at midnight the sun sets below the horizon by about 7°.

In general, the period of white nights depends on the specific area and varies from May 25-26 to July 16-17.

This interesting phenomenon can be observed in temperate and high latitudes before and immediately after the summer solstice in a fairly large territory of Russia, as well as throughout Finland and Iceland, in most of Scandinavia, as well as in some regions of Estonia, Great Britain, the USA and Canada.
