From the scientific point of view, fog is the accumulation of water in the air and the further formation of little condensation products of water vapor. Moreover, the lower the temperature, the more ice crystals are there in the fog instead of water drops.

Fogs can vary in density and duration, from a couple of hours to several days.

Coastal fogs can be dense and opaque, like cotton wool. For example, Dubai is almost completely hidden in fog twice a year, in spring and autumn. And in Florida in February 2012, the fog was so impenetrable that it was possible to photograph it only from above using helicopters.
